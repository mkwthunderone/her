                <p>To be who you are, after all you have been through at the hands of this world, is beautiful.<br> You who happened to be the reason behind stolen glances and and random smiles.<br> I dearly hope  that by this point you've finally understood that your sole existence isn't merely<br> an existence but a precious and gentle comfort to every life your presence has touched - especially mine.<br> Cliche as it may sound, you matter more than you know.</p>
